.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.
.SH OVERVIEW
The simple shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is the program that is started when a user logs into the system. It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).
.SH INVOCATION
.B hsh
can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively. If
.B hsh
is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (as determined by
.BR isatty (3)),
the shell is interactive. An interactive shell prompts before each command and handles programming and command errors differently.
.PP
When
.B hsh
is executed, it reads and executes commands from its input. If the end of file is reached, the shell exits.
.SH DEFINITIONS
.TP
.B blank
A space or tab character.
.TP
.B word
A sequence of characters treated as a single unit by the shell. Words are separated by blanks.
.TP
.B name
A word consisting solely of letters, numbers, and underscores, and beginning with a letter or underscore. Names are used as shell variable names.
.TP
.B control operator
A token that performs a control function. It is a newline or one of the following: '||', '&&', '&', ';', ';;', '|', '|&', '(', or ')'.
.SH SIMPLE COMMANDS
A simple command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by blank-separated words, terminated by a control operator. The first word specifies the command to be executed. The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.
.PP
The return value of a simple command is its exit status.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken:
.PP
1. If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
.PP
2. If the name is neither a shell builtin nor contains a slash,
.B hsh
searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
.PP
3. If the search is successful, the shell executes the named program in a separate execution environment.
.PP
4. If the search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error message and returns an exit status of 127.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the environment. This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value.
.PP
The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment. On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the
.BR waitpid (2)
system call or equivalent function. Exit statuses fall between 0 and 255. A zero exit status indicates success. A non-zero exit status indicates failure.
.PP
If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127.
.SH SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
The following builtin commands are supported:
.TP
.B cd [DIRECTORY]
Change the current working directory to DIRECTORY. If no argument is given, the command is interpreted as
.B cd $HOME.
If the argument
.B \-
is given, the command is interpreted as
.B cd $OLDPWD.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment.
.TP
.B exit
Cause the shell to exit.
.TP
.B setenv VARIABLE VALUE
Initialize a new environment variable, or modify an existing one.
.TP
.B unsetenv VARIABLE
Remove an environment variable.
.SH COMMAND LINE EDITING
.B hsh
does not provide command line editing capabilities. Each command must be typed completely before pressing Enter.
.SH PROMPTING
When executing interactively,
.B hsh
displays the prompt
.B "$ "
when it is ready to read a command.
.SH PATH RESOLUTION
When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it is a builtin command. If not, the shell searches each entry in the PATH environment variable, in order, for the command.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B SIGINT
The shell ignores SIGINT during processing but allows child processes to handle it. When the shell waits for a child command to complete, it waits for the child to exit or be terminated.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Interactive mode:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ /bin/ls
file1  file2  file3
$ pwd
/home/user
$ exit
$
.RE

.PP
Non-interactive mode:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
file1  file2  file3
$ cat test_commands
/bin/ls
/bin/pwd
$ cat test_commands | ./hsh
file1  file2  file3
/home/user
$
.RE

.PP
Using builtins:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ env
USER=holberton
HOME=/home/holberton
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
$ setenv MY_VAR hello
$ env | grep MY_VAR
MY_VAR=hello
$ unsetenv MY_VAR
$ cd /tmp
